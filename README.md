# FinalWebProj

My idea of a final project would be a sort of planner that you can put down easily. I have a hard time with dates and reminders, and physical planners have worked wonders or me, I think this would work wonders too. 
The project would be set up with different categories. To the left of the screen could be reminders/a to-do list. Center would be a calender, and to the right you can put up tabs like "sticky notes" if something comes up that day as your sort of other form of reminders. All of them would be interactive, allowing user interface. Maybe also a notes feature if I have the time to add it in. 
I'm planning on the project also having a customizable ability, hopefully, where the user can change to different themes if I learn them in time. Say you don't want to have the white, you want a dark blue and light blue theme. Or a mint and light yellow theme. The user can change the colors to help them remain active. 
The person would also need to save it somewhere so I might try to add in an email and phone needed category, so that you can be texted reminders or emailed them of what you have planned. It's a big project, but I look forward to working with it .
